# Some concise and practical guidelines for writing efficient, fast, and lightweight Bash/Shell scripts

## especially for system tasks or automation:

---

## 🔧 1. **General Principles**

* **Keep it POSIX-compatible** unless Bash-specific features are necessary.
* **Write small, modular scripts** – easier to test and reuse.
* **Prefer built-ins**  (`echo`, `read`, `test`, `[ ]`, `cd` )
* over external commands for speed.
* **Minimize forks** – every external command (like `grep`, `awk`) spawns a process.

---

## ⚡ 2. **Performance Optimization**

* **Avoid subshells** (`$(...)` or `(...)`) unless needed.
* Use **Batch operations**  instead of  looping (e.g., use `xargs`, brace expansion).
* **Use arrays** in Bash when processing large input sets.
* **Redirect once** instead of per line:
  Bad:

  ```bash
  while read line; do echo "$line" >> output; done < file
  ```

  Better:

  ```bash
  while read line; do echo "$line"; done < file > output
  ```

---

## 📦 3. **Tool Selection Tips**

* Prefer:

  * `[[ ... ]]` over `[ ... ]` (Bash)
  * `(( ... ))` for arithmetic
  * `read -r` to avoid backslash escapes
  * `printf` over `echo` (more portable and predictable)
* Use:

  * `cut`, `tr`, `sed`, `awk` **judiciously**
  * `grep -q` for silent matches (faster than piping to `/dev/null`)

---

## 🧠 4. **Code Practices**

* **Quote everything** unless expansion is intended:

  ```bash
  "$var" vs $var
  ```
* **Use `set -euo pipefail`** at the top for robustness:

  ```bash
  set -euo pipefail
  ```
* **Check return codes**, don’t assume success:

  ```bash
  if ! do_something; then
    echo "Failed"
    exit 1
  fi
  ```

---

## 🧪 5. **Testing & Debugging**

* Use `bash -n script.sh` for syntax check.
* Use `bash -x script.sh` for step-by-step tracing.
* Add log/debug mode:

  ```bash
  debug() { [[ "$DEBUG" == 1 ]] && echo "[DEBUG] $*"; }
  ```

---

* Rely on coreutils when possible (`basename`, `dirname`, `sort`, `uniq`).
* Use `/bin/sh` shebang if Bash isn't required.

---

## 📁 7. **Files and Paths**

* Use absolute paths in cron or system scripts.
* Quote file paths: `"$filename"` (handles spaces).
* Prefer `/tmp` or `mktemp` for temporary files.

---

## 🔐 8. **Security**

* Sanitize input:

  ```bash
  case "$user_input" in
    [a-zA-Z0-9]*) ;; # acceptable
    *) echo "Invalid input"; exit 1 ;;
  esac
  ```
* Avoid `eval` unless absolutely necessary.
* Don’t trust user input in filenames or commands.

---

## ✅ 9. **Use Functions**

* Break large scripts into functions for reuse and clarity.
* Keep global state minimal; pass arguments explicitly.

  ```bash
  do_backup() {
    local src="$1"
    local dst="$2"
    cp -r "$src" "$dst"
  }
  ```

---

## 📌 10. **Structure Template**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

check_requirements() {
  command -v curl >/dev/null || { echo "curl required"; exit 1; }
}

parse_args() {
  # Parse command-line arguments
}

run_task() {
  # Main task here
}

main() {
  check_requirements
  parse_args "$@"
  run_task
}

main "$@"
```

---


Parallel & thread example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

# Maximum number of parallel jobs (threads)
MAX_JOBS=$(nproc)  # Or set manually, e.g., MAX_JOBS=4

# Print messages with timestamps
log() {
  printf "[%s] %s\n" "$(date +%H:%M:%S)" "$*"
}

# Fake task simulating a heavy job
fake_job() {
  local task_id=$1
  log "Starting task $task_id"
  sleep $((RANDOM % 4 + 1))  # Sleep between 1-4 seconds
  log "Finished task $task_id"
}

# Thread pool: run job in background and wait if pool is full
run_in_pool() {
  fake_job "$1" &

  # Track jobs
  joblist+=($!)

  if [[ ${#joblist[@]} -ge $MAX_JOBS ]]; then
    wait "${joblist[0]}" 2>/dev/null || true
    joblist=("${joblist[@]:1}")
  fi
}

main() {
  joblist=()

  log "Starting parallel job runner with max $MAX_JOBS jobs"

  for i in {1..12}; do
    run_in_pool "$i"
  done

  # Final wait for all remaining jobs
  wait

  log "All tasks complete"
}

main "$@"

```


## Threading specific

Threading in shell scripting isn't *real* multithreading like in compiled
languages (C, Rust) or high-level scripting languages (Python). Instead, it's
**process-level parallelism** — but it's powerful and efficient for many
automation tasks.

 **process-level parallelism**
Below is a **complete guide to threading/parallelism in shell scripts**:

---

## 🧠 Core Concept: Simulated Threading via Background Processes

* In Bash, every command can run **in the background** using `&`:

  ```bash
  command &  # background job
  ```

* Use `wait` to **pause** the script until those background jobs finish:

  ```bash
  wait  # waits for all background jobs
  ```

---

## ✅ Minimal Example: Run Tasks in Parallel

```bash
#!/bin/bash

task() {
  echo "Task $1 started"
  sleep 2
  echo "Task $1 done"
}

for i in {1..3}; do
  task "$i" &
done

wait  # Wait for all background tasks
echo "All tasks complete"
```

Output (unordered due to concurrency):

```
Task 1 started
Task 2 started
Task 3 started
Task 1 done
Task 3 done
Task 2 done
All tasks complete
```

---

## 🧵 Example: Thread Pool with Max Parallel Jobs

This is essential to **limit concurrency** (like CPU threads):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

MAX_JOBS=4
joblist=()

task() {
  echo "Working on $1"
  sleep 3
  echo "Done with $1"
}

run_in_pool() {
  task "$1" &

  joblist+=($!)

  # If too many jobs are running, wait for the first to finish
  if (( ${#joblist[@]} >= MAX_JOBS )); then
    wait "${joblist[0]}"
    joblist=("${joblist[@]:1}")
  fi
}

for i in {1..10}; do
  run_in_pool "$i"
done

wait  # Final wait for remaining jobs
echo "Finished all"
```

---

## ⚡ Tools for Parallelism

### 1. **`xargs -P`** (Parallel from stdin)

```bash
cat urls.txt | xargs -n 1 -P 4 curl -O
```

* `-n 1`: One argument per command
* `-P 4`: Max 4 parallel jobs

### 2. **`GNU parallel`** (Highly recommended)

```bash
parallel -j 8 echo ::: a b c d e f g h
```

* `-j 8`: Run 8 parallel jobs
* `:::`: Input list

```bash
# Download 5 files at once
parallel -j 5 curl -O ::: https://site/file{1..20}.zip
```

> 📦 Install: `sudo apt install parallel`

---

## 🔒 Safe Practices

* Always `wait` to avoid leaving zombie processes.
* Redirect logs to individual files when running jobs concurrently:

  ```bash
  ./job.sh "$i" > logs/job$i.out 2>&1 &
  ```
* Use `mktemp` for temporary files in parallel scripts.

---

## 💡 Advanced Patterns

### Parallelizing Functions Dynamically:

```bash
run_task() {
  echo "Doing task $1"
  sleep $((RANDOM % 5 + 1))
  echo "Finished task $1"
}

for i in {A..E}; do
  run_task "$i" &
done

wait
```

### Parallel Loop Over Files:

```bash
for file in *.log; do
  gzip "$file" &
done
wait
```

### Parallelize With `find`:

```bash
find . -type f -name '*.log' | xargs -n 1 -P 4 gzip
```

## ✅ Summary: When & How to Use “Threading” in Shell Scripts

| Use Case                   | Best Technique               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Simple background job      | `cmd &` + `wait`             |
| Concurrency with limits    | Thread pool via `wait` array |
| Command-line args or stdin | `xargs -P`                   |
| Complex pipelines          | `GNU parallel`               |
| One-off job batching       | Brace expansion `{}`         |

---

## 🧪 Template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

MAX_PROCS=4
joblist=()

my_task() {
  echo "Starting $1"
  sleep 2
  echo "Done $1"
}

run_parallel() {
  my_task "$1" &
  joblist+=($!)
  if [[ ${#joblist[@]} -ge $MAX_PROCS ]]; then
    wait "${joblist[0]}"
    joblist=("${joblist[@]:1}")
  fi
}

for arg in "$@"; do
  run_parallel "$arg"
done

wait
```

## Above script explained

Here's a **detailed analysis and explanation** of your Bash script — which
implements a **parallel job runner with a controlled thread pool** using native
Bash constructs.

---

## ✅ Overview

This script simulates **multithreading in Bash** by:

* Running background tasks with `&`
* Tracking their process IDs (PIDs)
* Limiting the number of parallel jobs to `MAX_JOBS`
* Waiting on jobs as the queue fills
* Cleaning up after all jobs finish

This is a **classic thread pool pattern** — very useful in systems automation, deployment scripts, and heavy task batching.

---

## 🔍 Line-by-Line Breakdown

### Shebang and safety

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

* Uses the `env` tool to find the user's preferred `bash` binary.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'
```

* `-e`: Exit on any command error.
* `-u`: Treat unset variables as errors.
* `-o pipefail`: If any command in a pipeline fails, the whole pipeline fails.
* `IFS=$'\n\t'`: Ensures safe word-splitting — avoids bugs when filenames have spaces.

---

### Set max parallel jobs (thread pool size)

```bash
MAX_JOBS=$(nproc)
```

* Uses the number of CPU cores (`nproc`) to determine how many tasks can safely run in parallel.
* You can override this by manually setting `MAX_JOBS=4`, etc.

---

### Timestamped logging

```bash
log() {
  printf "[%s] %s\n" "$(date +%H:%M:%S)" "$*"
}
```

* Utility function to log messages with the current time (for progress tracking).
* Clean and helpful for debugging concurrency.

---

### Simulated task (the “job”)

```bash
fake_job() {
  local task_id=$1
  log "Starting task $task_id"
  sleep $((RANDOM % 4 + 1))  # 1–4 seconds
  log "Finished task $task_id"
}
```

* Represents a CPU-bound or I/O-bound task (like a build, fetch, or compress).
* Random sleep simulates jobs taking different times.

---

### The thread pool logic

```bash
run_in_pool() {
  fake_job "$1" &
  joblist+=($!)
```

* Runs `fake_job` in the background (`&`) and stores its PID in `joblist`.

```bash
  if [[ ${#joblist[@]} -ge $MAX_JOBS ]]; then
    wait "${joblist[0]}" 2>/dev/null || true
    joblist=("${joblist[@]:1}")
  fi
}
```

* When the job queue hits the max (`MAX_JOBS`), it waits for the **first** job to finish.
* Then removes it from the `joblist` to make room for the next.

✅ **This is the core logic** that simulates threading by controlling the concurrency pool manually.

---

### Main controller

```bash
main() {
  joblist=()
  log "Starting parallel job runner with max $MAX_JOBS jobs"
```

* Initializes the job list.
* Logs startup message.

```bash
  for i in {1..12}; do
    run_in_pool "$i"
  done
```

* Launches 12 fake jobs in parallel.
* Only `MAX_JOBS` run concurrently; the rest wait their turn as previous ones finish.

```bash
  wait
  log "All tasks complete"
}
```

* Ensures the **remaining background jobs** (after loop finishes) are completed before exit.
* Logs success.

### ✅ What *Does* Affect Performance in Parallel Bash Scripts?

| Factor                           | Affects Speed? | Explanation                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Number of background jobs**    | ✅ Yes          | More jobs = more concurrency, up to CPU/memory limits.                    |
| **How you manage concurrency**   | ✅ Yes          | Using `wait`, `xargs -P`, or `GNU parallel` properly improves throughput. |
| **Subshell avoidance**           | ✅ Yes          | Fewer subshells = fewer forks = faster.                                   |
| **Minimizing external commands** | ✅ Yes          | Built-ins are much faster than invoking `awk`, `grep`, `sed`, etc.        |
| **Loop type (`for` vs C-style)** | ❌ No           | Purely syntax: both compile to the same kind of interpreted loop in Bash. |
