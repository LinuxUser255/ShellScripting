# THIS IS THE SECURITY HARDNED CUSTOM SSHD_CONFIG
#########################################################
# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.
# This is the configuration we shall use for HARDN-XDR
# Much of the settings in this file are from.
# https://linux-audit.com/ssh/audit-and-harden-your-ssh-configuration/
# And they are set as the result of much lynis testing.
# It is Configured according to lynis security testing
# This is the configuration file that will be implemented as part of
# HARDN-XDR
# All the uncommented lines are self-explanatory


# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.
