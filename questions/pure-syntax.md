- Context: I come from a traditional style of Shell Scripting, but I want to get good at the style presented in pure-bash.md.
- Therefore, I need some help in understanding this differnt style and syntax.
- Can you give a detailed explaination of this `cycle()` function?
- I understand what it is doing, but I need a detailed break-down of certain parts.
- Most especially, Give a detailed educational explanation on the following syntax and the characters used.
```bash
    printf '%s ' "${arr[${i:=0}]}"
    ((i=i>=${#arr[@]}-1?0:++i))
```
